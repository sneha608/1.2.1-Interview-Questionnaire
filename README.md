# 1.2.1-Interview-Questionnaire

1. What motivates you to do well in school?
2. How do you usually handle stress from schoolwork or activities?
3. Which subject do you enjoy the most?
4. What do you think is the biggest challenge in school?
5. How often do you participate in extracurricular activities (clubs, sports, etc.)?
6. How do you prefer to learn new material in school?
7. What type of technology do you use most for schoolwork?
8. How often do you feel that your teachers provide useful feedback on your assignments?
9. What is your preferred way to relax after a busy school day?
10. Do you feel that your school prepares you well for your future career or college?

I developed these questions for my questionnaire because I am curious about how my peers feel about their daily experiences in school. I want to know if I can relate to them and gather data about issues they may face in school.
